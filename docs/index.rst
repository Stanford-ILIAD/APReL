Welcome to APReL's documentation!
=====================================

**APReL** is a unified Python3 library for active preference-based reward learning methods. It offers a modular framework for experimenting with and implementing preference-based reward learning techniques; which include active querying, multimodal learning, and batch generation methods.

Not sure what preference-based learning means? Read on or check `our talk at AI-HRI 2021 <https://youtu.be/HExrlibCxdI>`_. You can also take a look at `our video <video.html>`_ which contains a simple example.
